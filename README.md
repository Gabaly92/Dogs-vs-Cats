# Dogs-vs-Cats
## Kaggle project for Udacity Capstone Project

In this competition, the goal is to use a machine learning algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat. 
If we look at this kind of problem from a high-level point of view, we would find that while a simple task like this one is 
easy for humans, on the contrary, it is very difficult for a computer. The purpose of this project is to determine how 
well an AI can get in solving an Asirra(Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access) which is basically a 
Captcha that asks people to identify photographs of cats and dogs to login in a website.

## The technologies and hardware that were used to solve this problem are as follows:
Python (Torch, Torch vision, Python imaging library)

Nvidia Titan X GPU
